# DeskClock
I remember that a friend used a sowftware to get a nice looking clock on his desktop. 
<br>
The problem was that it was not free. So I made it myself, to save some money.

## Controls
You can access the Settings via the Windows Taskbar (it is minimized)

<br>

**to close the window click the cross at the top right on the settings window**
<br>

**press the big red button to close DeskClock** (*Windows + alt + c* to minimize)
<br>

## Extra
The first time you click on the exe it will want you to download .Net 6.0 which is needed.<br>
just follow the instructions<br>
