# DeskClock
I remember that a friend used a sowftware to get a nice looking clock on his desktop. 
<br>
The problem was that it was not free. So I made it myself, to save some money.

ps: if you add letter in the fontsize section it wont change size until ther is a number between 0 and 300

**right click and choose "Beenden" to end the program** ("Quit" in german)

## Extra
The first time you click on the exe it will want you to download .Net 6.0 which is needed.<br>
